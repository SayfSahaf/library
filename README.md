I have made this simple web app to practice object-oriented programming principles in Javascript.

This web app uses an array to store book objects. Whenever an object is added or removed, the browser dynamically updates the information on the screen without reloading the webpage.

The book objects will disappear once the webpage has been reloaded, so storing the objects locally is a feature I have yet to implement.

Overall, this project was a great practice and a welcoming break from my academics.
